# Floating Debris Detection
Welcome to the Floating Debris Detection repository! The Floating Debris Detection project is a part of our Autonomous Boat project, aims to provide an automated solution for solid floating waste identification, collecting in timely before they pollute the river.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on training the YOLOv11 model to accurately detect floating solid waste. The model is trained to detect and classify two conditions: 'Bio-degradable' and 'non Bio-degradable' waste.

## Getting Started
To run the training script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MdSyamul/Floating-Debris-Detection.git
    ```
    
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It’s recommended to use Python 3.12.3 for compatibility.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv floating_waste_env
    source floating_waste_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: lettuce_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install PyTorch**: Ensure you install a version of PyTorch compatible with your CUDA version. Follow the instructions at [PyTorch's official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the correct version.

4. **Install Ultralytics**: This package includes necessary tools for training.

    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics
    ```

5. **Run the Training Script**: Open the `train.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to begin training.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook train.ipynb
    ```
## Results
The training process generates logs, visualizations, and model checkpoints, which can be used to assess the model's performance and make further improvements.

### Training Performance
The following plots show the training and validation loss over 120 epochs, as well as the precision, recall, and mAP (mean average precision) metrics.

- **Box Loss**: The reduction in the bounding box loss over time indicates that the model is learning to detect floating wastes more accurately.
- **Classification Loss**: The decreasing classification loss shows that the model is improving in identifying the correct class for each detection.
- **DFL Loss**: This tracks the distribution focal loss, and the decline shows better focus on relevant regions.
- **Precision & Recall**: These metrics show how well the model identifies true positive cases versus false positives and negatives, improving over time.
- **mAP**: The increasing mAP values, both for IoU thresholds of 50% and 50-95%, demonstrate the model's performance across various intersection over union thresholds.

### Inference Examples
Below are sample predictions made by the model on floating wastes images. The bounding boxes highlight the areas identified as floating wastes.

These results demonstrate the model's ability to detect and classify multiple waste instances within a single image.

By reviewing these results, improvements in both accuracy and precision can be identified for future iterations.
